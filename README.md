## Configure and verify

1.  Locate the paths on your system.
    - Open File Explorer and navigate to the directories listed above.
    - Verify that the paths exist and contain the expected executables.
2.  Add relevant paths to your systemâ€™s `PATH` environment variable and
    verify the setup.
    - For a step-by-step guide with screenshots, see [how to set the
      `PATH` environment variable in Windows](path.md).

Now you should be able to use R and its associated tools from the CLI
without specifying full paths.
